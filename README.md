# devsecops-test1

__In this DevSecOps test, interviewees will have to repair the `circleci` pipeline.
This test is intended for a 1-on-1 interview where BOTH interviewer and interviewee
are in the same room or screen sharing. After the interview is completed, the branch
that the candidate push to the repo MUST NOT be merged into `main` and NEEDS to be
deleted. This ensures that the next candidate cannot crib off of previous conducted
tests.__

## Problems

- Candidate must fix the `.circleci/config.yml` so that it satisfies
the following pipeline criterias:
  - test
  - build
    - (optional bonus) store artifacts
- (optional bonus) Candidate must fix the test(s) that are broken
